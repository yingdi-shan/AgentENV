/// artifacts. A record is the catalog identity and lifecycle state for a snapshot:
///
/// - template records may exist before build artifacts are committed
/// - sandbox records are created by publishing an already captured runtime snapshot
/// - committed records carry a [`crate::snapshot::CommittedSnapshot`] payload with artifact
///   references
///
/// Implementations are responsible for durable state that may be shared across processes or nodes:
///
/// - snapshot records and template build state
/// - alias-to-snapshot bindings
/// - committed artifacts such as Firecracker snapshots and managed layers
/// - publish / delete visibility rules
///
/// Callers may assume returned records describe durable repository state rather than process-local
/// working directories or node-local runtime cache files.
///
/// The repository boundary intentionally excludes node-local derived state. In particular:
///
/// - local build-artifact allocation is owned by the manager rather than the repository
/// - runtime-ready `image.json` files should be materialized by [`SnapshotRuntimeResolver`]
/// - node-local cache directories should not leak back into snapshot records
/// - repository implementations should not require sandbox launch code to understand backend-specific
///   local build layouts
///
/// Backend guidance for shared POSIX or distributed filesystems:
///
/// - alias claim / release should be concurrency-safe
/// - publish should only make aliases visible after the snapshot record and committed artifact
///   payload are durable enough for subsequent readers to resolve
